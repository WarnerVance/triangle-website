            Triangle Fraternity (EST 1907), is a social fraternity exclusively for 
            Engineers, Architects and Scientists. Our purpose is to develop balanced 
            men who cultivate high moral character, foster lifelong friendships and 
            lead lives of integrity. We offer countless leadership opportunities, 
            avenues for community service, scholarships and much, much more. Triangle, 
            thus, provides a bridge between academic life and a career, as well as a 
            foundation for success in the years after college.

              The Wisconsin Chapter was founded in 1913. We currently own two houses on North Breese Terrace, 
              located right by Camp Randall Stadium and by the College of Engineering. Since its inception, the
              Wisconsin Chapter has worked to become leaders and foster positive impact within the UW Madison community.
              We actively collaborate with our alumni, Triangle National HQ, the Greek Community, and The College of Engineering
              to ensure our members receive the most out of their college and Triangle experience.
